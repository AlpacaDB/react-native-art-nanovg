## react-native-art-nanovg

`react-native-art-nanovg` is a replacement for ReactNativeART that uses the OpenGL vector drawing library NanoVG as a back-end, and replaces some of the weirder ART programming choices (like that horrible way of drawing arcs).


### TODO:
1. Fix radial gradients.
2. Android version.
3. Respect the border radius of the Surface.
